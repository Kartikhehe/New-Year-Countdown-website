# New-Year-Countdown-website
Took total 16 to 18 hours, to learn as well as implement the website which includes a complete all nighter. Hope this gets selected ( if it deserves to be ).
This is a recruitment task for the winter project by Google Developers Clubs of IITK. This is a basic website using basics of HTMl, CSS and Javascript.

Things to note:
1. The website, right hand side, i.e my info section has a background with birds and clouds etc. That is not actually a background, but a collection of different images put together there. Everything placed one by one, such as the seagull, clouds, sun etc.
2. Tried to make the website as responsive as possible. Checked for few of the currently most used devices, ipad screen, recent apple and other phones, and most importantly laptop screen(mine is macbook). Tried to make it responsive for most of the devices, used these days, with good resolutions.
3. The Happy new year message wasn't implemented properly, I couldn't add a lot of cool designs to it, due to time constraint. So, made it really simple.
